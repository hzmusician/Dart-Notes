My project where I briefly shared the Dart language notes.I tried to use a simple and understandable language as much as possible in the project. I wanted to reinforce the subject by preparing examples.
I want you to grasp a topic that you forgot or want to learn quickly, with examples.

I haven't completed the project yet, but I will prepare a nice Dart language notes project for you with the content that is getting richer every day. 

> [!NOTE]
> Comment lines are in TR language.

I will classify each topic in a different file and share it. Thus, instead of a complex and long file, there will be a library of fragmentary and understandable files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I used VS Code as compiler and Android SDK is not installed.

I hope it will be a useful project for you.
